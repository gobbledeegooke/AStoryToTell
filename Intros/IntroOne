You awake lying on rough, hewn stone. Dampness presses against your cheek and the thin layers of fabric that cover the rest of your body do little to protect against the chilled air.

A steady drip can be heard as you awaken further, your body shuddering as you rise to sit. While rising into a sitting position you feel the urge to vomit, do you? (y/n)

*If yes*
Despite feeling the burning assault on your throat and nose, you instantly feel better releasing whatever it was that was inside you. Reinvigorated, you decde to stand and get your bearings.

*If no*
You halt you process halfway through to prevent your vertigo from making you spew up whatever remains from your last meal. It is only a few moments before the sensation passes and you find your way to your feet, surveying the space you are in.

*Continued*
Looking about, it is easily recognisable that you are in a open cavern, roughly 30 meters long and 5 meters across. The majority of the cave is cast in shadow and you find yourself situated in the most well lit corner. Looking to the ceiling, you can see a small opening roughly 100 meters up that is letting sunlight illuminate the space you are in. In the opposite corner, within the shadows, there appears to be a hole in the stone that leads into the darkness.
