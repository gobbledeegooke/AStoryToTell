In this cavern you find a stream.

While you had seen water drip from jagged rocks, this is a stream that moves lazily within a portion of rock that is slightly shallower than the rest.

You remember hearing that moving water is much safer to drink from than its stagnent counterpart, do you drink from the stream? (y/n)

* If Yes*

Cupping your hands you bring a few handfuls of water to your lips. The cureent was crisp and cool and you feel much better than you did before.
(+2 hp or something, I don't know, that is not my area to decide)

*If No*

While running water might be safer, it isn't packaged in a Fiji bottle, so you don't trust it.
Who knows what could have shit in it only a few caverns away?
