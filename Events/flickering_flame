#Unique event. If you would like this more than once, I can permutate the writing slightly so it is different.

This open space of cave greets you in supernova, blinding light searing your eyes as you enter.
After letting your eyes adjust to the brillance, you see that a flame is coming from a campfire in the middle of the room.
Do you approach?

# I like asking "do you approach more than I have to so as to build tension even if there isn't any

{*If yes*

Stunned to see a flame just sitting, you let yourself move closer to examine it more closely.
Now that you are closer, you can tell it is clearly fire; flicking light casting the room aglow.
However, the small inferno does make you feel unsettled, if only you could put your finger on it...

{*If perception > 2*
# Or however the hell you want to deal with leveling perception, or random chance, I couldn't care less
Ah, yes, it is the fact that the flame produces no heat. Getting more curious, you bring your hand closwer to the flame then would be safe, but still no heat sears you.
Do you touch the flame?

*If yes*

As expected, the flaming log feels completly cool to the touch, still shedding its llight throughout the chamber.
You smile to yourself, this could prove useful.
# The player should get a *cool fire* torch, and this might be a useable item for perception skills checks, etc.

*If no*

Despite feeling no heat, you are not stupid enough to shove your hand into fire. However, not heat means there isn't really a reason to stay, so enjoying th ebrillance one last time, you continue your trek

}

*If insufficent perception*

You can't seem to place what is off. Perhaps later. For now, you move on.

}

*If no*

Fire surely means that someone is not far off, and while you long for company, you also recognise that company may bring about danger, so you avoid the fire for now and move on your way.
