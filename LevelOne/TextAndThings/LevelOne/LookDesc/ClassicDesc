Looking about reveals nothing more than damp, grey stone.

You see water drip lazily from stalactite to stalagmite. Other than this, nothing seems to move.

While looking, you feel something squish from under your foot. Looking down, you see it was nothing more than a few toadstools.

Along this stretch of wall, you see carved into the stone the shapes of graves: the names of which have long since become unreadable.
