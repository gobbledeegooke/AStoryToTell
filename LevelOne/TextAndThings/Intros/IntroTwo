You awake to blinding sunlight striking you from above. Through bleary eyes you see sunbeams fall through leaves of tree branches high above you. However, looking side to side you see that you are roughly 15 meters below the surface.

The hole you find yourself in looks like a mass grave used for piling in those too poor to afford private graves for themselves. The dirt walls look dug with proper equipment and it would be near impossible to scale.

Looking around the grave itself, which is circular in shape and no more than 5 meters in radius, you find a section of earth that looks more like soil than the light brown, clay based soil that makes up the rest of the grave.

Digging through, you find a metal trapdoor that opens to a old wooden ladder that descends into darkness.
