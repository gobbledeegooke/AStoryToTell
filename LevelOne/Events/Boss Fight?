# I can make some more, as these might be a good way to give out equipment
# Example ideas: giant squid, giant snake (alluding to more monsterous beast on the next layer), etc.

As you continue down this hallway you hear rapid scuttling from further down the passage. After spending some time down in the bowels of the Earth you recognise the sound nearly instantly.
Crabs.

Not scared, but also not particularly excited you continue down the corridor.

Not but 20 meters or so later do you hear the scuttling approaching you rapidly. Becoming defense, you heart sinks as close to a dozen crabs coome swarming all at once.
You lash out at one as it runs towards you, but it doesn't stop and engage, as other crabs have, but continue its beeline past you as if you were not even there.

Taking the event as it comes, you continue forward another ~50 meters until the passage opens into a large chamber with a large rock in the center of the cavern.

Moving in, you only get a few steps in before the ground rumbles and the rock in the middle of the room begins to shift.
Before you the rock reveals itself to be a crab, easily 10 feet tall with pincers the size of you legs.

Before you can even think to run, you realise that this beast could easily outpace you to the edge of the chamber, you have no choice but to fight.
At the ground next to your feet, you find a few jars that glow a soft orange next to a mostly decayed corpse. Snatching them up, not wanting to let a possible advantage go to waste, you could almost swear the corpse is giving you a smile of fortune.

You collected three jars of the mystery substance, and the crab now barrles down on you.

# The "King crab" needs a entry
# The jars are of alchemist made "Sticky fire", glowing a unatural neon orange when meeting air or water
# These things should fucking hurt, particularly things with skin/leather, and slightly less so to carpasses and shells
