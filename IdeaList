GAME STUFFFF

“****” marks story events, plot stuff, interesting nuggets if you will

previous people stuff:
-black acid used for exavation(?)

layer 1:
	yeah its pretty much written already
	magical stuff doesnt reach up this far?
layer 2:
	- should have miniscule magic elements, 
		water droplets hanging in the air slightly too long
		rocks that are warm?
		gravel wiggling?
		^ yeah there should probably be evidence of the necrobotany that is to 			come
		idk u get the message
	worms driven up here by alechemists?
	***** dead wurm corpse possible event ****
		-explore inside the corpse
		-maybe something trapped inside stuck to the (ribs?, entrails? special 			sauce?)
		-but taking it out would discolour/injure/disfigure your arm (because its 			toxic, as you learn from the wurm maggots)
		- oo look at that it fits with the _theme_ 
layer 3:
	necrobotanyy
	maybe rogue plants from alchemist?
	necrobotanists are maybe considered heretics to the people below, hence 		why they were sent up to the third layer
	remnants of experiments from where it started attacking
	****alchemist workshop****
		-notes, papers and others lying around
		-display case of (weapon? tome? vial?)
		-notes give clear warnings of the thing in it
		-makes you less human some how, increased anger? ( thatd be cool 				with less control over character somehow?,worse random events)
		
layer 4:
	hanging forest
