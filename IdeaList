GAME STUFFFF

“****” marks story events, plot stuff, interesting nuggets if you will

previous people stuff:
-black acid used for excavation(?)
-two main groups of people, the magicians and the alchemists
[


	magicians:
		use power of the cave to do magic
			things to consider:
				how to they channel it?
				through what medium?	
				what can they accomplish with it?
	alchemists:
		use materials from the cave for alchemy
			things to consider:
				how to they extract/use the magic
				sustainable? (are either of them?)


	big questions:
		how does the use of the caves properties disfigure them like they do the player?
	
	necrobotanists:
		combine both, so both groups hate them
		“unpure”
		hence why theyre in shambles, poor, sent up to third layer with poor materials

]
layer 1:
	yeah its pretty much written already
	magical stuff doesnt reach up this far?
layer 2:
	- should have miniscule magic elements, 
		water droplets hanging in the air slightly too long
		rocks that are warm?
		gravel wiggling?
		^ yeah there should probably be evidence of the necrobotany that is to 			come
		idk u get the message
	worms driven up here by alechemists?
	***** dead wurm corpse possible event ****
		-explore inside the corpse
		-maybe something trapped inside stuck to the (ribs?, entrails? special 			sauce?)
		-but taking it out would discolour/injure/disfigure your arm (because its 			toxic, as you learn from the wurm maggots)
		- oo look at that it fits with the _theme_ 
layer 3:
	necrobotanyy
	maybe rogue plants from alchemist?
	necrobotanists are maybe considered heretics to the people below, hence 		why they were sent up to the third layer
		maybe for combining dark magic / the cave
	remnants of experiments from where it started attacking
	use spores/grafts from layer 4 
	****alchemist workshop****
		-notes, papers and others lying around
		-display case of (weapon? tome? vial?)
		-notes give clear warnings of the thing in it
		-makes you less human some how, increased anger? ( thatd be cool 				with less control over character somehow?,worse random events)
		
layer 4:
	hanging forest
	plants growing off the “cave spikes” (stalcite? idk the word) on the ceiling, making it look like trees hanging upside down
	flora should have animalistic properties. vines moving on their own, bioluminescence 
	glowing floating spores?
	
	Event idea:
		cloud of spores floating around item, risk breathing in 
layer 5:
	ideas: acid lake (roots from layer 4 deposit acid and over time?) , mushroom forest (this would explain the spores),
