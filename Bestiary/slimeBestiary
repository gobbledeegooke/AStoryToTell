slime {
  1:
    The creature seems to be a ball of translucent gloop with two randomly pointed eyestalks with a single eye at the end of each, not unlike a massive, round, gluttonous snail.
    It is a surprise that this creature is around at all because it is only seen to be rolling around aimlessly with no decernable goal.
    Encountered in the first layer, the slime is a glutonous mass about waist height that come in a variety of colors. Warmer colors seem less frequent than the cooler colored slimes.
    As the slime rolls around, it picks up small insects and plantlife that then become suspended within it, slowly digesting within the mass of slightly corrosive slime.
    Slimes also seem to leave behind a trail of ooze that pulls up pockets of minerals due to the acidic nature of the ooze they produce.
