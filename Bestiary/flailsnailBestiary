flailsnail{
  1.
An ordinary snail except instead of a head it has a multitude of extensions with large growths on the ends with spikes extruding out of them. It's mouth seems to have no teeth, perhaps after being bashed with it's adornments there is no need to chew.
  2.
Contrary to the typical first thought, the flailsnail is an herbivore. Using sticky slime secreted from its underside, it climbs to the top of a cave and smashes up roots and other flora in the dirt,later to be ingested. It's slime glands can be used to afix two items together. (reproductive system?,lifespan?,stages of life?)
