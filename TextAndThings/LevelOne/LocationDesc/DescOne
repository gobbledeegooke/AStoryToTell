A steady dripping can be heard in the distance.

The darkness of the cavern makes it hard to see any details but a sparkle of ivory catches your eyes to the left of the small chamber.

Do you investigate?

*If yes*

Moving closer, it becomes clear that ivory was indeed the correct color, as the glint came from slightly yellowed bones peering out from a mess of fabric that may have once been someone's clothes. Patting through the pockets, it was clear whatever this person may have once had is long gone by now.

However, as you turn away, you eyes are drawn upwards to the cave wall just above the disturbing figure. Carved into the wall is the words "Only way is up." Thoroughly disturbed, but keeping the advice of the dead in mind, you head off.

*If no*

Wary of glints in the dark, you pass from the chamber satisfied that perhaps curiosity did kill the cat, but you will be wiser.
