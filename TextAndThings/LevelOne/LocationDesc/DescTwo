Moss grows thick over this section of rock and you couldn't help but notice it looks too similar to a bed for your liking.
Shaking of a bit of your exhaustion, you realise this would be an ideal place to rest for a while.
Do you rest?

*If yes*

{
% chance of healing
A chance to level stats (id you are doing that)
}

{
% chance of random monster encounter
I think there should be a higher chance of the monster dropping loot for these fights (sinc ethe player would have to dight when they wanted to rest)
}


*If no*

Shaking your head gave you a *second* wind, so you press on.

# I think it would be funny to increase the *second* wind to third, forth, fifth, etc. as the player progresses and takes less adn less rests
# It also introduces a challenge element
