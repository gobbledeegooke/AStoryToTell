Entering the chamber, you are greeted by a sea of small black beads.

The chamber itself is easily the largest subterranean space you have ever seen. Disappearing into darkness to the left, right, and even straight up, you focus your attention to the sea of beads before you.

Each bead was jet black, its surface slightly reflective, and no bigger than a grape.
Not seeing an easy way across, you assess you options.

# This is suppossed to be confusing and hard. There should maybe be text on how to ignore this challenge, becuase there isn't a good way to do it.

*If "look at beads"*

Inspecting the beads more closly, you realise that they seem to have two details you missed upon first glance.

One: They are each inscribed with a rune. 
*If int >= 6*
The rune you take to say "closterum", which feels like prison, barrier, or contain.
*else*
However, the rune is gibberish, and you're not sure what to make of it.

*Go left or right*

It is a little more than a kilometer wlk before you hit a rounded corner that wraps into the sea of beads.
It seems as if there isn't a way to continue other than forward.

*If: swim in beads*

Sinking into the beads, you feel yourself begin to sink immediatly.
Deciding to let go of the rock you had been holding onto, you attempt to stay afloat in the beads as if you were treading water.

Barely a second went by before you realised that this would get you killed.
The beads offered little to no tension for you to stay afloat with.
You immediatly pull yourself back onto the safety of the rocks.

*If: inspect walls*

  *If int >= 5*
  
  Along the walls there appears to be runes that you believe to say "vesctio", which could mean a way through, or safely travel.
  
  *else*
  
  There  is clearly writing on the walls, but it is unintelligble.


# Hey Ben, so lets be real for a minute, I really liked the idea of this room, but have no sweet fucking clue on how to use it
# This means I want the player to only be able to complete his room with the use of a speific "magic" phrase or achemical device
# However, that means I need more ideas (and time), so this will probably be marked as incomplete for a hot minute
# Bare with me, I have plans, just no modivation or dedication
